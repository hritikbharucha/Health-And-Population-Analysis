# Health-And-Population-Analysis
In this notebook, I extracted a subset of relevant data for my linear regression model from the data csv file. The model analyses the relationship between the population for each country against health expenditures, birth rates, death rates, hiv prevalence, number of undernourished people, and people with access to improved sanitation facitilites and improved water sources. By using the numpy, pandas, and matplotlib python libraries, I was able to fit the training data to a linear regression model, evaluate its accuracy, and compare the predicted values to the actual values.
